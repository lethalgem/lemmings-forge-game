## Description
In the cosmic expanse of "Gravity Forge," master the art of interstellar transportation through a puzzling universe where gravity is both your ally and adversary. As an aspiring space trucker, you are plunged into the clandestine world of galactic ore transport. Navigate through 18 challenging levels by manipulating the trajectory of ore between planets using the gravitational forces of black holes, the repulsion of white holes, and the strategic redirection provided by spaceships and wormholes.

Each level expands the complexity of your tasks, starting from simple maneuvers to multi-ore logistics that require precise planning and execution. The game is not just about connecting points but forging paths through an intricately designed starfield where every celestial body has a role. From the bustling ore mines on distant planets to the ultimate goal of a massive antimatter processing facility, your job is to fuel an interstellar forge that drives the galaxy's economyâ€”and its dark underbelly.

Discover a narrative of ambition and intrigue as you rise from a rookie to a key player in a galactic conspiracy. Interact with quirky NPCs, dodge the machinations of the mafia-controlled cosmos, and maybe, just maybe, forge your own destiny among the stars.



## Controls
* Planets
  * Rotate Launch Angle: Left-click and right-click on a planet or use the left and right arrow keys to adjust the launch angle of the ore.
* Black Holes 
  * Increase or decrease the gravitational pull by left-clicking and right-clicking or using the left and right arrow keys.
* White Holes
  * Same controls as black holes, but with the effect of repelling the ore.
* Spaceships
  * Adjust the direction of ore ejection by rotating the spaceship 360 degrees, using the same controls as for planets.
* No Control Zones
  * Gravity Bubbles: These are antigravity zones where black and white holes do not affect the ore.
  * Extra Dark Black Holes: Function like regular black holes but cannot be controlled.
  * Worm Holes: Automatically transport ore from one hole to its pair. The entry angle affects the exit trajectory.
* Camera Movement
  * Pan: Click and drag the map or use the WASD keys. Hold Shift with WASD for faster movement.
  * Zoom: Use the scroll wheel or Q and E keys to zoom in and out. Hold Shift with Q and E for faster zooming.
